<a class="fb-linky"  data-linkPicture="http://gottaBeARealWebsiteNoLocalhost.com/imagename.jpg" href="#">link content</a>

Not sure what we want to grab for each link yet, let's talk about that. Hopefully we can grab it dynamically from content and images in the page, via id's.



Twitter

<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?
        url=http://yourpalsonja.com/overflow
        &via=twittername
        &text=400%20More%20Bitumen%20Tankers%20in%20Vancouver">

Unfortunately, none of this shit can be auto-populated. Trying to work on API for it. For right now, an image can appear in a "card" format below the tweet. But not in the tweet itself. You can only do that through API.
